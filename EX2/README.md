EX2:
Overview üìù
-
This project aims to solve a common business problem for financial institutions: determining the loan amount that can be safely offered to an applicant. By analyzing features such as applicant income, co-applicant income, credit history, and property area, the model provides an estimated loan amount.

The process involves:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data and handling missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data to find relationships between features.

Model Training: Implementing a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.

Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy using standard regression metrics.

Of course, TT. Here is the content for a README file for a loan prediction model using linear regression.

Loan Amount Prediction using Linear Regression
A machine learning project that predicts the eligible loan amount for an applicant based on their financial and demographic details. This model is built using a multiple linear regression algorithm.


Dataset üìÅ
-
The dataset used for this project is sourced from a common Kaggle competition. It contains various attributes of loan applicants.

Source: Loan Prediction Dataset (Placeholder Link)

Key Features: ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, Loan_Amount_Term, Credit_History, Property_Area, etc.

Target Variable: LoanAmount

Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
-
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Install required libraries using the requirements.txt
2. Run the loan.ipynb file present in the repository


Model Performance üìä
-
The model's performance was evaluated on the held-out test set using the following metrics:

R-squared Score: 0.68

This indicates that approximately 68% of the variance in the LoanAmount can be explained by the features in our model.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Provides the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
