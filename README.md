Machine Learning Lab Experiments 

This repository serves as a collection of my machine learning projects and lab experiments. Each directory contains a distinct experiment, complete with the dataset, code, and analysis.


Common Tech Stack 

The following tools and libraries are commonly used across these experiments:

    Language: Python 3.x

    Libraries:

        Pandas

        NumPy

        Scikit-learn

        Matplotlib

        Seaborn

    Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Repository Structure

Each experiment is self-contained within its own directory. Inside each project folder, you will typically find:

    A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with the complete code, visualizations, and analysis.

    A data/ folder containing the dataset used.

    A specific README.md explaining the project in more detail (optional).
